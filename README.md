# PyPI_Package_Info_Collector
This script fetches information about Python packages from the PyPI repository, processes each package to retrieve details about its versions and dependencies, and stores this information in a JSON file. Additionally, it handles errors gracefully and logs any packages that could not be processed to a separate JSON file.
